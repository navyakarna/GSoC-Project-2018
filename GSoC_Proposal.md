===Synopsis
About the app:
The Wikimedia Commons Android app allows users to upload pictures from their Android phone/tablet to Wikimedia Commons. Wikimedia commons accept only freely licensed media files (that are not subject to any copyright). Users can upload images and then add various tags specific to them such as category, title, and description, license.

About the project:
This project is aimed at providing an option to browse/search the Wikimedia Commons using the app.

**Why this feature is needed?**
- More and more, users are asking (as evidenced by Play Store feedback), people want to be able to also browse existing Commons images via the app.
- Quality of uploads should increase by letting users see other people's work.

**What can be implemented ?**
- Image Search on Wikimedia Commons using a title.
- Restrict the search results to images, or make sure no crash happens when opening exotic formats such as SVGs or sounds
- Link to the Media Details activity to see an image's details (Needs feedback)
- Category Search on Opening details shows the sub-categories and the images present in that category
- Modify the category activity to show the best images first. (Bonus)

**How it can be implemented?**
- Explore Mediawiki APIs to search images using titles, search categories.(Probably using SEARCH API) 
- Implement async calls requests to request Search pictures 
- Develop feature for displaying search results in Featured Images Activity.
- Implement async calls requests to request Search Categories 
- Implement the category activity, which shows the sub-categories and the images present in that category
- Debugging, testing followed by code documentation.
- Release (at least in alpha)

**Mentors** 
- @Nes 
- @Nicolas_Raoul

===About Me

**Personal background**

I am a third-year B.Tech. undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/) . I am pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering as my Major. I have a keen interest in Android App development( I have been doing Android App Development from last 2 years). I use git and Github every day and I am well acquainted with how to use them for version control.

**How did you hear about this program?**

Heard about GSoC in a campus meetup. I am an open source enthusiast from past 1 year, I've always wanted to take part in Google Summer of Code.

**Time during Summers**

I have no other commitments this summer. So I'll be able to give 40 hours or more per week. My summer break starts on 30th April so I can start working full time from that day on. I'll not be taking any vacations. My classes start around 20th July but I will be able to commit enough time to the project as there are no exams during the period

**Eligible for Google Summer of Code and Outreachy ?**

I am applying only for GSoC as I am not eligible for Outreachy program. I am applying under Wikimedia Commons Android only.

**What excites me about this project**
//TBU
I loved the goal of Wikimedia Foundation "Global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world".
I would be really great for me to apply my skills and contribute to such an organization.

==Past Experience

Iâ€™ve been doing Android development in my First year. My first project was a Home Automation app to control LED lights using our mobile phone(Raspberry Pi behaving as a server)that I built in a hackathon. Since I am a part of CyberLabs (Cyber Society of my College), we organize sessions to teach juniors the basics of Technologies. After that I had made several projects for my learning and few apps.  for various startups across India. Some of them are :

1. VegWorld: An Grocery Delivery App 
- Google Play Link (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grocery.codenicely.vegworld_new&hl=en)
2. Easy Invoice Manager: App to manage digital Invoices, Quotations, Expenses. Also, the user can share, mail, print the invoices. 
- Google Play Link (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asap.codenicely.pdf.gstinvoicing.free.mobile.easy.gst.invoice.quick.quickinvoice.gstinvoicing&hl=en)
