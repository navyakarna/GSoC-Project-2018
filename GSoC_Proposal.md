===Synopsis
**About the app:**
The Wikimedia Commons Android app allows users to upload pictures from their Android phone/tablet to Wikimedia Commons. Wikimedia commons accept only freely licensed media files (that are not subject to any copyright). Users can upload images and then add various tags specific to them such as category, title, and description, license.

**About the project:**
The goal of this project is to enhance the already working Wikimedia Commons App by implementing an option to browse/search the Wikimedia Commons Repository.

**Why this feature is needed?**
- More and more, users are asking (as evidenced by Play Store feedback), people want to be able to also browse existing Commons images via the app
- Quality of uploads will increase by letting users see other people's work

**What can be implemented ?**
- Image Search on Wikimedia Commons using a text
- Restrict the search results to images
- Category Search  
- Previous Search queries of images and categories ( Recent Search history )
- Shows the sub-categories and the images present in that category/subcategories inside it

**How it can be implemented?**
- Explore Mediawiki APIs to search images using titles, search categories.(Probably using [Mediawiki Search API](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query%2Bsearch)) 
- Implement Search activity which will contain 2 fragments (1 for showing image list, 1 for showing category list)
- One fragment will be a new instance of Featured images fragment to reuse the code and functionality, other will be a new fragment for showing category list
- Implement async call requests to request Search pictures, Search Categories dynamically on page scroll 
- Develop feature for displaying search results in Search Activity
- Saving the clicked category/ images in the local database and showing in the recently searched list ( both categories and images ) if a search query is empty
- Implement the category activity, which shows the sub-categories and the images present in that category(reusing featured images fragment)
- Improving category activity by showing best images(images inside subcategory) 

====Prototype:

Iâ€™ve been working on this feature for some time now. I had made a small prototype for the same. 

- **Description**

> - Added a Separate activity for search in which an edit text is present.
> - Implemented a viewpager along with a tab layout in the activity
> - Added Browse Image fragment, Browse Category Fragment in the item of the viewpager.
> - Now if a text is changed in the activity I am calling update list method in both the fragments with search query as a parameter.
> - Method update list updates the list by fetching details from [Wikimedia API: Search](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query%2Bsearch)
> - For updating the list in recycler view I had added AdapterFactory, Renderer similar to other modules.

===Timeline

| **Period** | **Task** | **Deliverables** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------|
| April 23 to May 14  | **Community bonding period.** - Communicate and bond with students and mentors, Create specific issues for the project, getting familiar with the app architecture and Wikimedia APIs, Learning RxJava, Getting Familiar with featured images scrollable activity, fragment implementation, Link featured images fragment with already existing media details page, making changes in media details fragment for extra details like author name (if it wasn't done already on featured image fragment)  | Community bonding report and blogs about the experience, app architecture |
| May 14 to May 20  | Add search button/layout in featured image scrollable activity to open Search Activity and decide and create UI mockup for search activity including image search list,  search history. | Search button/layout in Featured Image Activity, Search Activity Mockup |
| May 21 to May 27  |  Add a new instance of featured image scrollable fragment in search activity/fragment. Modify featured image scrollable fragment to show search image results. Use the [Mediawiki Search API](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query%2Bsearch) to search image list results  (using title). The list will load Search results dynamically on page scroll. using recycler view callback we will fetch new image list with offset. | Working Search images feature with dynamic scrolling |
| May 28 to June 4 | Store search results in the local database to show search history. Restrict the search results to images, or making sure no crash happens when opening exotic formats such as SVGs or other formats, show search history if the search query is null | Image Search History  |

===About Me

**Personal background**

I am a third-year B.Tech. undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/) . I am pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering as my Major. I have a keen interest in Android App development( I have been doing Android App Development from last 2 years). I use git and Github every day and I am well acquainted with how to use them for version control.

**How did you hear about this program?**

Heard about GSoC in a campus meetup. I am an open source enthusiast from past 1 year, I've always wanted to take part in Google Summer of Code.

**Time during Summers**

I have no other commitments this summer. So I'll be able to give 40 hours or more per week. My summer break starts on 30th April so I can start working full time from that day on. I'll not be taking any vacations. My classes start around 20th July but I will be able to commit enough time to the project as there are no exams during the period

**Eligible for Google Summer of Code and Outreachy ?**

I am applying only for GSoC as I am not eligible for Outreachy program. I am applying under Wikimedia Commons Android only.

**What excites me about this project**
I had developed a lot of apps during my college days, but I always wanted to develop apps that really help people. I loved the goal of Wikimedia Foundation "Global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world".
I would be really great for me to apply my skills and contribute to such an organization.

==Past Experience

Iâ€™ve been doing Android development since my first year. My first project was a Home Automation app to control LED lights using our mobile phone(Raspberry Pi behaving as a server)that I built in a hackathon. After that, I had started making apps for my learning purpose. Apart from the prototypes, I had also developed 2 apps that are on Google Play.

**Spectrum'18:** 
I had developed this app for our departmental fest of electronics engineering (Spectrum). It has features like login, OTP verification using the phone number, Show list of events day wise, register for events, send notification for events.

- Github Link: https://github.com/Tech-ISM/spectrum-android-app

**Brand Store:** 
It is an app where users can get offers from nearby shops of different categories across their city. Shops can also register them and show their offers to the users of the app. Although the startup is closed now. but the app is still on google play.
