# GSoC-Proposal

My Wikimedia Commons App GSoC Proposal

The Wikimedia Commons Android app allows users to upload pictures from their Android phone/tablet to Wikimedia Commons.

My proposal was to develop a Feedback Sharing Module in Wikimedia Commons App. The project aims at sharing feedback about uploaded photos, educating people about topic & copyright.
